          We at Rainydays are conscious of our social responsibilities with
          regards to helping the environment through our working practices. Our
          objective is not only to sustain our environment for our descendants
          but also to rehabilitate the damage previously done. We believe that
          our corporate responsibility goes beyond our proprietary borders and
          therefore every effort will be made to conserve resources throughout
          our operations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rainydays will try to not only meet existing environmental laws and
          regulation, but will endeavour to go beyond the status quo and see
          techniques and approaches that position us ahead of our competition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Growth of our company depends on our abilities to minimise or
          eliminate our impacts on our surroundings. Our ultimate success
          depends on the environmentof the United Kingdom, without a beautiful
          country, our customers will cease to come. Our company's future and
          the future of our environment are interconnected.
        </p>

        <h2>Following are our specific ideals:</h2>

        <h3>Awareness and Commitment</h3>
        <p>
          Our policy towards the environment will be readily available and
          promoted to our guests. We will endeavour to ensure staff and guests
          are familiar with and implement our environmental commitment and
          objectives.
        </p>

        <h3>Practical Implementation:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Rainydays environmental policy will be available to view on our
            website.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rainydays environmental will be present in guest-room's handbook.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rainydays environmental will be available in the kitchen handbook.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Transport</h3>
        <p>
          Rainydays will endeavour to reduce the impact on the environment where
          ever possible with respect to transport.
        </p>
        <h3>Practical Implementation:</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Seek and employ local products and services to reduce transport
            costs.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rainydays will avoid unnecessary travel, and will use energy
            efficient vehicles and driving styles.
          </li>
          <li>Encourage the use of public transport, cycle or foot.</li>
          <li>
            To eliminate unnecessary and inefficient use of Rainydays owned
            motor vehicles, and wherever possible, that of other vehicles
            (including guest vehicles) associated with Stansted Lodge. Where
            ever possible car pooling will be implemented.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Energy & Water Consumption</h3>
        <p>
          Rainydays accepts a share of the UK's commitment to a reduction in
          carbon dioxide emissions both by attaining greater efficiency in total
          energy consumption and by continuing to examine the possibility of
          acquiring electricity from 'green' sources when finances permit,
          either through the purchase of 'green' electricity, or through an
          increased use of solar water heating, combined heat and power plants
          (CHP), or photo-voltaic.
        </p>

        <h3>Practical Implementation:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Rainydays will make every effort to use water efficiently and avoid
            pollutants entering the drainage system.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rainydays will use energy efficient products where ever practical,
            and monitor usage to achieve minimum energy consumption.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Waste Generation and Management</h3>

        <p>
          Rainydays will try to minimize the production of waste and pollution;
          including unnecessary packaging. Rainydays will implement measures to
          reduce the volume of waste generated and to increase the proportion of
          that waste which is recycled.
        </p>

        <h3>Practical Implementation:</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Rainydays will look to compost organic waste.</li>
          <li>
            Rainydays has implemented four separated recycle bins for glass,
            paper, plastic, and cans/tins.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Materials and Resources</h3>
        <p>
          Rainydays will try to minimize environmental impact with regard to
          sourcing materials and resources.
        </p>

        <h3>Practical Implementation:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Rainydays will avoid using materials which have an undesirable
            effect on the environment, and wherever possible use locally made
            recycled goods.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rainydays will try to use contractors who also share a commitment to
            the environment, and take into account lifetime costs of materials
            when repairing, altering or rebuilding premises.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rainydays will maximize use of electronic communication and
            information storage as an alternative to paper, and take into
            account the environmental quality and impact of food products and
            where possible to purchase food which has been grown locally.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Natural Environment</h3>

        <p>
          Rainydays will help to protect and enhance natural habitats and
          wildlife, take appropriate opportunities to enhance them and be
          sensitive to landscape issues. Look to minimize impact on local
          wildlife, and to look for opportunities to work with the local
          community in caring for the local environment. Rainydays will
          endeavour to be aware of local planning developments and take
          appropriate action where these are potentially damaging to the
          environment.
